# Serverless ML Inference Pipeline

Team: Machine Minds  
Members: Ahmet Emin, Munashe, Tinashe

## Week 1 Goals
- ✅ Local inference with ResNet18 + CIFAR-10  
- ✅ Hello World Lambda on AWS  
- ✅ Project structure & Notion board created  

## Overview
This project aims to build a serverless machine learning inference pipeline using AWS Lambda.
The model (ResNet18) will perform image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The cloud layer will handle request routing and scalability.
Documentation will track weekly progress.
